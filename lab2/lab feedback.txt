put nusnet ID e0543721 at the top instead of matric number

You called MyTimer directly for the first call instead of using glutTimerFunc

Your MyTimer function is not doing anything, instead everything is passed onto UpdateAllDiscPos(), which is not good structure (does not adhere to separation of concerns);

- You should be calling UpdateAllDiscPos in MyTimer and having the glutTimerFunc be MyTimer as well
